# Sketchbook projects
This is a collection of simple web projects that I've written over the years. Nothing fancy, mostly fun.

Sources will be found in the appropriate folder, and links to the live websites below.

## The "projects"
### [Simple Chess Clock](https://rasmussehlin.github.io/chess_clock/)
We played alot of chess in school. There were more chess boards than clocks, so we made our own. Best used on a phone/tablet.

### [Draw in Stereo](https://rasmussehlin.github.io/draw_in_stereo/)
Draw stereoscopic paintings in your browser. A very simple drawing demo where you draw on two canvases at the same time. You need to use a scrollable mouse. The scroll level determines the distance between the dots on the different canvases; resulting in you being able to determine the "depth" that you draw at. Use [this cross-eyed technique](https://youtu.be/zBa-bCxsZDk) (at your own risk, probably not awesome for your eyes...) to see your masterpiece in it's 3-dimensional glory.

### [Sun Planet Shading](https://rasmussehlin.github.io/sun_planet_shading/)
Move the sun to change the shadow on the planet. Uses CSS shadowing.

### [Simple Stroboscope](https://rasmussehlin.github.io/simple_strobe/)
A full screen stroboscope script. Updates when you change the values in the boxes. Duration is in milliseconds.
