# Sketchbook projects
This is a collection of simple web projects that I've written over the years. Should be viewed as an art school applicant's sketchbook. Nothing fancy, just fun.

Sources will be found in the appropriate folder, and links to the live websites below.

## The "projects"
### [Simple Chess Clock](https://zehle.github.io/chess_clock/chess_clock.html)
We played alot of chess in school. There were more chess boards than clocks, so we made our own. Best used on a phone/tablet.

### [Draw in Stereo](https://zehle.github.io/draw_in_stereo/draw_in_stereo.html)
Draw stereoscopic paintings in your browser. A very simple drawing demo where you draw on two canvases at the same time. You need to use a scrollable mouse. The scroll level determines the distance between the dots on the different canvases; resulting in you being able to determine the "depth" that you draw at. Use [this cross-eyed technique](https://youtu.be/zBa-bCxsZDk) (at your own risk, probably not awesome for your eyes...) to see your masterpiece in it's 3-dimensional glory.

### [Sun Planet Shading](https://zehle.github.io/sun_planet_shading/Sun%20is%20up!.html)
Move the sun to change the shadow on the planet. Uses CSS shadowing.

### [Simple Stroboscope](https://zehle.github.io/simple_strobe/strobe.html)
A full screen stroboscope script. Updates when you change the values in the boxes. Duration is in milliseconds.
